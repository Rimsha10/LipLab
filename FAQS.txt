FAQ'S

HOW LONG DOES THE DELIVERY OF ORDER TAKE?

It usually takes 2-4 working days. But in some cases the delivery time can exceed to 6-12 days.


ARE THE PRODUCT SAMPLE SIZES OR FULL SIZE?

All products are full sized, similar to those of other nationally recognized cosmetic companies.


WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN YOUR PRODUCT?

All the ingredients we use in a product are listed on the package or the label of the product itself.  For products too small to accommodate the list, a separate ingredient list is available on the display unit in the store for your convenience. 


HOW CAN I RECEIVE COUPONS/SAMPLES OR PROMOTIONS?

We offer coupons and promotions in local newspapers, the Sunday supplement, magazines and stores.


DO YOUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN FRAGRANCES?

Yes! Fragrances and flavors are used in our cosmetic products to counteract inherent smells or the original taste of the formula. Fragrances  emphasize the active ingredient concept and enhance well-being when using the product.


HOW LONG DOES MY PRODUCT KEEP AFTER OPENING?

Our cosmetic products have a symbol with their so-called period after opening (PaO). The PaO indicates how many months the product keeps for after it is first opened.
